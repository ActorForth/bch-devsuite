## Contributing

### Report a Bug

To report a bug, open an issue on GitHub with the label `bug` using the available bug report issue template. Please ensure the issue has not already been reported.

### Suggest an Enhancement

To suggest an enhancement, please create an issue on GitHub with the label `enhancement` using the available feature issue template.

### Open a Pull Request

* Fork the repo, create a branch, submit a PR when your changes are tested and ready for review

Note: if youâ€™d like to implement a new feature, please consider creating a feature request issue first to start a discussion about the feature.

## Style Guides

### Git Style Guide

* Keep a clean, concise and meaningful git commit history on your branch, rebasing locally and squashing before submitting a PR
* Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ and summarised in the next few points
    * In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
    * In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
    * Limit the subject line to 72 characters or less
    * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line
    * Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`)

### Python Style Guide
* Please [lint with Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) before commit
